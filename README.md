# Refactor nREPL

nREPL middleware to support refactorings in an editor agnostic way.

The role of this nREPL middleware is to provide refactoring support for clients such as [clj-refactor.el](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el).  As such, this middleware doesn't perform any refactorings, but returns the information about what needs doing to the client.

## Usage

### Adding the middleware via Leiningen

Add the following, either in your project's `project.clj`,  or in the `:user` profile found at `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[refactor-nrepl "0.2.2"]]
```

### Clojure client

A clojure client is provided for demonstrative purposes, and to make some refactorings available from the REPL.

The refactoring functions are provided as public functions of the `refactor-nrepl.client` namespace. To work with these functions, you need to connect to a nREPL server which has the `refactor-nrepl` middleware enabled.

To connect you have two options:

1. Call `connect`, store the returned `transport` and pass this to all the refactor functions.
2. Call the refactor functions without a transport, in which case the client will create and store its own transport.

You also need to pass in the path to the file you want to refactor. Pass in a path as you would provide it for `slurp`. You might also need to pass in more optional or required arguments depending on the the refactor function -- see the documenation of the refactor functions in the `refactor-nrepl.client` namespace.

## Available features

### Find (debug) function invocations

Searches for invocations of predefined list of functions.

Expected input:
- ns-string -- the body of the namespace to work with
- refactor-fn -- value: "find-debug-fns"
- debug-fns -- coma separated list of functions to find invocations of

Returns tuples containing [line-number end-line-number column-number end-column-number fn-name].

The functions to look for should be listed in a comma separated string, either fully qualified or just the function name. If the fully qualified name is provided the middleware will find the invocations of the function if it is required plainly or with an alias. For example:

```clojure
(:require [clojure.set]
          [secret-santa.util :as u])
```

However, if only the function name is provided the middleware will find invocations of the function where it is referred. For Example

```clojure
(:require [clojure.set :refer [difference]]
          [secret-santa.util :refer :all])
```

In case your client wants to find core clojure functions (for example `println`) list them only with the function name. A list of functions names to find: `"println,pr,prn,secret-santa.util2/foobar,print-let,print.foo/print-let"`.

Example call from the repl using the clojure client:

```clojure
(require 'refactor-nrepl.client)
(def tr (refactor-nrepl.client/connect))
(refactor-nrepl.client/remove-debug-invocations :transport tr :file "src/secret_santa/core.clj")
```

### Find Referred

This is only available as a temporary performance tweak for [clj-refactor.el/remove-requires](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el#usage). Remove unusued requires is planned to be migrated as a whole (and hopefully improved too) in the near future to be supported by the middleware. This feature might not be supported anymore by then.

### Artifact lookup

This middleware provides operations for obtaining information about artifacts from clojars, or mvn central.

Two ops are available:

#### artifact-list

Takes no arguments and returns a space-separated list of all available artifacts.

#### artifact-versions

Takes one required argument, `artifact` which is the full name of the artifact e.g. `core.clojure/clojure`, and one optional argument `force` which indicates whether we should force an update of the cached artifacts.

The return value is a space-separated list of all the available versions for the artifact.

### find symbols

Finds occurrences of symbols like defs and defns both where they are defined (if available) and where they are used.

#### find usages (application of find symbols)

Finds occurrences of symbols like defs and defns both where they are defined (if available) and where they are used and prints them.

Example call from the repl:
```clojure
(refactor-nrepl.client/find-symbol :ns 'leiningen.gargamel :name "gargamel-changelog")
```

#### rename symbols (application of find symbols)

Finds and renames occurrences of symbols like defs and defns both where they are defined -- if it makes sense -- and where they are used. Uses the same backend function: find symbols. Replacing the occurrences is implemented in the client.

```clojure
(refactor-nrepl.client/rename-symbol :ns 'leiningen.gargamel :name "gargamel-changelog" :new-name "garg-cl")
```

### clean-ns

The `clean-ns` op will perform the following cleanups on an ns form:

* Eliminate :use clauses
* Sort required libraries, imports and vectors of referred symbols
* Rewrite to favor prefix form, e.g. [clojure [string test]] instead
  of two separate libspecs
* Raise errors if any inconsistencies are found (e.g. a libspec with more than
  one alias.
* Remove any unused namespaces, referred symbols or imported classes.
* Remove any duplication in the :require and :import form.

The `clean-ns` requires a `path` which is the absolute path to the file containing the `ns` to be operated upon.

The return value, `ns` is the entire `(ns ..)` form in prestine condition, or `nil` if nothing was done (so the client doesn't update the timestamp on files when nothing actually needs doing).

Pretty-printing the `(ns ..)` form is surprisingly difficult.  The current implementation just puts stuff on the right line and delegates the actual indentation to the consumer.

In the event of an error `clean-ns` will return `error` which is an error message intended for display to the user.

**Warning**: The `clean -ns` op dependes on `tools.analyzer` to determine which vars in a file are actually being used.  This means the code is evaluated and any top-level occurrences of `(launch-missiles)` should be avoided.

### resolve-missing

The goal of the op is to provide intelligent suggestions when the user wants to import or require the unresolvable symbol at point.

The op requires `symbol` which represents a name to look up on the classpath.

The return value `candidates` is a space separated string of candidates to import or require into the current ns.

### hotload-dependency

Loads a new project dependency into the currently active repl.

The op requires `coordinates` which is a leiningen style dependency.

The return value is a `status` of `done` and `dependency` which is the coordinate vector that was hotloaded, or `error` when something went wrong.

### find-unbound

This op finds unbound vars in some ns on the classpath.  In `clj-refactor` we use this as the underlying op for the `extract-function` refactoring: anything unbound in the body of the newly created defn has to be function parameters.

This op requires `ns` which is the name of a namespace on the classpath in which to find unbound vars.

Return valus `status` of `done` and `unbound` which is a space-separated list of unbound vars, or `error` when something went wrong.

## Development with `mranderson`

[mranderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson) is used to avoid classpath collisions.

To work with `mranderson` the first thing to do is:

`lein do clean, source-deps`

this creates the munged local dependencies in target/srcdeps directory

after that you can run your tests or your repl with:

`lein with-profile +plugin.mranderson/config repl`

`lein with-profile +plugin.mranderson/config test`

note the plus sign before the leiningen profile.

If you want to use `mranderson` while developing locally with the repl the source has to be modified in the `target/srcdeps` directory.

When you want to release
locally:

`lein with-profile plugin.mranderson/config install`

to clojars:

`lein with-profile +plugin.mranderson/config deploy clojars`

## Changelog

* Add `hotload-dependency` which loads a new project dependency into the repl
* Add caching of ASTs for better performance
* Add `resolve-missing` which resolves a missing symbol by scanning the classpath

### 0.1.0

* find (debug) invocations
